\begin{acknowledgements}      

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Zoubin Ghahramani.
He has been very supportive whilst allowing my mind to wander as much as I desired.
Working with Zoubin has made PhD life quite the antithesis of the vision presented in PhD comics and other web cartoons.

Thank Dan and Peter in particular for first project.

Thank Alex for data mining.
Dave for collaboration.
Josh and Roger for collaboration.
Yarin for contrarianism.

Finally, I would like to thank all of my friends at Trinity college, past and present.
Mention Alexa and Matt for scholarly discourse and Sonnex for attempted scholarly discourse :)
Thank Rosie for a reminder that there is more to life than mathematics.
